# Welcome to the Laka Technical Test
The objective of the test is to create a TODO list for forgetful developers.    You can use any technology you like to complete the following requirements. As a general rule, you should spend 1-2 hours on the assignment.

 - Users must be able to add and edit a list of TODO items. An item should have  a description and an auto-generated ID (such as #1, #2, etc)
 - Users must be able to delete an item
 - Users must be able to mark and unmark an item as completed
- Some of your users have never seen a  TODO list before, so be creative!
- Persist the task list, so if someone leaves the page and comes back they don't lose their progress


## Bonus points

If you have time, you might consider adding the following:

- Allow for multiple lists of tasks
- Allow for each task to have a title and a description
- Add some functional tests to prevent breaking changes in the future
- Anything else you can think of that might impress us!

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch. When you're finished, just send us an email with the code and a paragraph or two explaining your design.
